    Acknowledgements

    I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to the osdev community and the broader open source community for their invaluable support and contributions that have made MinmusOS possible.
    Special thanks to the osdev community for providing a resource-rich platform that has been instrumental in the development of MinmusOS, offering guidance and expert advice. I am also deeply grateful to every contributor in the open source realm who has shared their knowledge, tools, and libraries, all of which have been essential in building a stable and efficient operating system. Additionally, my heartfelt appreciation goes out to my peers and mentors whose insights and encouragement have supported me throughout this journey.
    Developing MinmusOS has been a challenging yet incredibly rewarding experience. This project has not only pushed my boundaries in terms of technical skills but also taught me the power of collaboration and open innovation.
    I am immensely proud of what we have achieved and I am grateful for every bit of help received along the way. This project is a testament to what we can accomplish together in the open source community.
    Thank you all for your support, contributions, and for believing in the vision of MinmusOS.
